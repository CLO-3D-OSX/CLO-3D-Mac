## üí° Overview  

**CLO 3D** is an advanced **3D fashion design software** built for modern apparel creators, pattern makers, and garment technologists. It brings together the artistry of fashion and the precision of technology, enabling designers to visualize and simulate real clothing with stunning accuracy and lifelike detail.  

The platform allows users to design garments digitally ‚Äî from **flat 2D patterns to fully simulated 3D outfits** ‚Äî using realistic fabric physics that replicate how materials fold, stretch, and drape. This innovation not only enhances creativity but also significantly reduces the need for physical prototypes, cutting both time and production costs.  

With features such as **customizable avatars**, **dynamic fabric simulation**, **pattern grading**, and **photo-realistic rendering**, **CLO 3D** delivers a complete virtual design experience. It also integrates seamlessly with **CLO-SET**, a cloud collaboration hub where designers, manufacturers, and clients can connect, review, and refine designs in real time.  

From fashion education to high-end production, **CLO 3D** empowers professionals to explore limitless creative possibilities while maintaining accuracy and sustainability throughout the design process.
